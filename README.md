This repository contains example projects that illustrate several methods of linking to igraph:

 - `cmake-project`: CMake project, using an existing igraph installation
 - `cmake-project-2`: CMake project, using igraph as a submodule
 - `basic-project`: Link to igraph manually

It is recommended to use CMake for your own project. CMake handles linking to igraph automatically and in a platform-independent manner.
