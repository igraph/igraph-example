### Example igraph project with CMake

CMake is the recommended way to use igraph in your project.

This method requires having igraph already installed. You may [compile it from sources and install it manually][1], or you can use a package manager. Most Linux distributions include igraph, although it may not be the latest version. On macOS, you can use MacPorts or Homebrew. On Windows, you can use vcpkg or MSYS2.

After you have installed igraph, see the tutorial for instrunctions on configuring and compiling this project:
